# Onboarding Specification Document
## AI-Powered Personal Fitness, Nutrition & Coaching Application (MVP)

---

## 1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the official onboarding flow for the AI-powered personal fitness application MVP.

The onboarding process is a **mandatory, structured, one-time configuration** that establishes the user’s fitness identity, goals, constraints, and commitments. All AI agents operate strictly within the boundaries defined during onboarding.

**Onboarding is treated as a contract between the user and the system.**

---

## 2. Core Principles of Onboarding
* **User-first, guided experience:** Step-by-step navigation without overwhelm.
* **Clear expectation setting:** Defined before data collection begins.
* **Fixed plans with flexible execution:** Structure is set, but daily life is accommodated.
* **No automatic changes:** The system will not alter core plans without explicit user intent.
* **Transparency and explainability:** Users know why data is requested.

**All onboarding inputs are:**
* Persisted to the user profile
* Shared across all AI agents
* Modifiable **only** upon explicit user request

## 3. Onboarding Flow Overview (Correct Order)
The onboarding flow follows this strict sequence:

1.  **Welcome & Ground Rules**
